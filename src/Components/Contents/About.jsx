        My journey into programming began during my first semester at university
        when I became fascinated with creating simple websites using{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">HTML</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">CSS</span>. As I got
        deeper into it, I realized the limitations of these languages and
        wondered how large, complex websites were made. This curiosity led me to
        learn <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">JavaScript</span>,
        a language I quickly grew to enjoy. Building increasingly complex
        projects, I discovered{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">React</span> and knew
        that web development was my passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my primary focus is on developing{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">my own projects</span>,
        continuously improving my{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">
          web development skills
        </span>
        , and immersing myself in{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-slate-200">constant learning</span>.
        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me hiking, fishing, or playing
        video games.
